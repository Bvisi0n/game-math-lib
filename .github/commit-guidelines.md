# Commit Message Guidelines

Use the following format:

```
[Action] [Scope] [Optional Context]

- [Short summary of what was done]
- [Where the change occurred]
- [Any tests, docs, edge case notes (optional)]
- Closes #<issue_number> (if applicable)
```

If the commit is related to an issue but **not yet closing it**, reference the issue manually in the message (`See #12`) or add a comment with the commit hash in the issue thread.
