# GameMathLib

**GameMathLib** is a lightweight, test-driven C++ math library focused on 2D vector operations for game development. It is modular, documented with Doxygen, and structured for easy integration into larger game engines or academic projects.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Immutable `Vector2D` class with value-returning methods
- Common operations: addition, subtraction, scalar division
- Dot product, length, normalization, perpendicular
- Tolerance-based equality with `Equals()`
- Defensive fallback logic (e.g., normalize `(0, 0)` â†’ `(0, 0)`)
- Operator overloading for intuitive usage
- Fully unit-tested using **Catch2**

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repository and open the `.sln` in Visual Studio (Windows) or use CMake for cross-platform builds.

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) (included via headers)

---

## ðŸ“š Usage Example
```cpp
#include "Vector2D.hpp"

Vector2D a{3.0f, 4.0f};
Vector2D b = a.Normalized();

if (b.Equals(Vector2D{0.6f, 0.8f})) {
    // do something
}
```
