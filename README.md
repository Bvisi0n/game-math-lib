# ðŸ§ª GameSystemsLab

**GameSystemsLab** is a personal playground â€” a sandbox where I write unit-tested, documented C++ code that relates to game development.

This isnâ€™t a framework.  
This isnâ€™t a library.  
This is my lab.

I use it to:

- Explore ideas
- Build reusable, engine-friendly tools
- Document game-related math and systems
- Keep a cheat sheet of stuff I donâ€™t want to reinvent every time

The structure may look suspiciously like a real library â€” and maybe one day it will be â€” but for now, itâ€™s just my collection of gists, experiments, and production-quality snippets, bundled together as a Visual Studio solution.

## ðŸ§¬ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Reusable math: vectors, matrices, transforms
- Catch2-powered unit tests for everything
- Doxygen comments throughout
- Modern C++ (C++20 required)
- Clean file structure, no build hacks
- **No executables** â€” this repo is lib-only by design

---

## ðŸš§ Warning

There is no roadmap. No milestones. No release plan.

I build whatever I want, when I want â€” and I try to write it well.

This is a **discovery environment** first, a **reference** second, and maybe someday a library or engine. Until then: itâ€™s just clean, tested code â€” growing one idea at a time.

## ðŸ§  Why I Made This

Because I got tired of:
- Rewriting the same math functions
- Digging through spaghetti from old projects
- Losing nice little snippets in jam folders
- Fighting frameworks when I just wanted a clean answer

GameSystemsLab is my answer to that:  
ðŸ“š A personal reference  
ðŸ§ª A safe place to test ideas  
ðŸ§  A showcase of my style, clarity, and discipline
